# Default values for openshift-projects.
# This is a YAML-formatted file.
# Declare variables to be passed into your templates.


projects: {}
# To define your own projects, remove the line 'projects: {}' and add your own
# definitions.
# 
# you can set tiller to false in the projects definitions to avoid
#  a tiller deploy in the projects.
#
# You can also enable the creation of a service account who has access to all
# deployed tillers. When running a helm client in a pod, in order for the helm
# client to talk to a tiller instance, it will need certain privileges to be
# granted. Specifically, the helm client will need to be able to:
#   - forward ports
#   - list pods in the namespace where tiller is running (so it can find tiller).
#
# Use this if you need a tiller-user who needs to deploy to other projects
# This will create a serviceAccount with the needed rights to access all tiller
# in each projects. The Service Account name is defined in the tiller definition.
# 
# Also the system:image-puller role should be granted to all projects who needs
# to pull an image from the base project, the one how is building images.
# If you define a tiller user service account, the image-puller access will also 
# be configured.
#
# In short:
#  - enable a tiller deployment with 'tiller: true'
#    in the 'projects' definitions
#  - enable Access on other projects with 'tillerUserAccess: true'.
#    in the 'projects' definitions
#  - set the tiller service account name with 'tillerUserServiceAccountName'
#    in the 'tiller' definitions
#  - define the project to host the service account with 'tillerUserServiceAccountNamespace'
#    in the 'tiller' definitions
# 
# example:
#
# projects:
#   my_cicd_project:
#     description: |-
#       CICD Project
#       This is my cicd Project
#     tiller: true
#   myproject1:
#     description: |-
#       My Project One
#       This is my first Project
#     tiller: true
#     tillerUserAccess: true
#   myproject2:
#     description: |-
#       My Project One
#       This is my first Project
#     tiller: true
#     tillerUserAccess: true


# Set the image, version tag and tiller user service account name for tiller
tiller:
  image: gcr.io/kubernetes-helm/tiller
  tag: v2.8.1
  # tillerUserServiceAccountName: cicd-deployer
  # tillerUserServiceAccountNamespace: dt-ftth-cicd
